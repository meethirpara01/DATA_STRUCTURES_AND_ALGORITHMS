# Code Explanation

## First Code:
```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std; 
 
int main() 
{ 
    cout << "Hello" << endl; 
    int n;

    if (cin >> n)
    {
        cout << "M E E T" << endl;
    }
    return 0; 
}
```
### Output:
```
Hello
```
(Then it waits for user input)

If the user enters a valid integer (e.g., `5`), the final output will be:
```
Hello
5
M E E T
```

### Explanation:
1. `"Hello"` is printed first.
2. `cin >> n;` waits for user input.
3. If the input is a valid integer, `cin >> n` evaluates to `true`, and `"M E E T"` is printed.
4. If the input is invalid (like a string), the condition fails, and `"M E E T"` is not printed.

## Second Code:
```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std; 
 
int main() 
{ 
    cout << "Hello" << endl; 
    int n;
    n = 10;
    if (cout << n)
    {
        cout << "M E E T" << endl;
    }
    return 0; 
}
```
### Output:
```
Hello
10M E E T
```

### Explanation:
1. `"Hello"` is printed first.
2. `n = 10;` assigns `10` to `n`.
3. `cout << n` prints `10` and returns `cout`, which is a valid stream object.
4. Since `cout` evaluates to `true`, `"M E E T"` is printed immediately after `10` without a newline.

### Key Differences:
| Aspect  | First Code | Second Code |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Input   | Requires user input | No input needed |
| `if` condition | Based on `cin >> n` (valid input check) | Based on `cout << n` (always true) |
| Output format | `"M E E T"` is printed only if input is valid | `"10M E E T"` is printed without waiting |
