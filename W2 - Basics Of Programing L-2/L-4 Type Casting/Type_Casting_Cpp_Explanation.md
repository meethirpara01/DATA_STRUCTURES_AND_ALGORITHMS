# Type Casting in C++

## 🔷 What is Type Casting?
**Type casting** is converting one data type into another. This is common in situations where:
- You need to perform operations between different data types.
- You want to control memory or precision.
- You need to interact with APIs that expect a specific type.

## 🔹 1. Implicit Type Casting (Automatic Type Conversion)

### ✅ What happens:
- The **compiler automatically** converts one data type to another.
- It usually **promotes** types to avoid data loss.
- Happens in expressions or assignments where types don't match.

### ⚙️ How it works:
- Smaller types are promoted to larger types (e.g., `int` to `float`, `char` to `int`).
- Follows a standard **type hierarchy**:  
  `bool → char → short → int → unsigned int → long → float → double → long double`

### 📌 Example:
```cpp
int a = 10;
double b = 5.5;

double result = a + b;  // a (int) is implicitly converted to double
```

### ⚠️ Things to Note:
- Safe in most cases.
- But might cause **unexpected behavior** if not careful, especially with narrowing conversions (e.g., `double` to `int`).

## 🔹 2. Explicit Type Casting (Manual Type Conversion)

This is when **you force the conversion** from one data type to another.

### ✅ Why use it:
- You need precise control.
- You’re converting from a **larger to a smaller** type (which may lose data).
- You’re handling **incompatible types**.

### 🔸 A. C-Style Cast
```cpp
float pi = 3.14;
int intPi = (int)pi;   // Drops decimal, result is 3
```

This is quick but less safe—harder to search and more prone to errors in large codebases.

### 🔸 B. C++ Style Casts (Safer, More Explicit)

| Cast Type              | Use For                               |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `static_cast<>()`      | Basic types like `float` to `int`      |
| `dynamic_cast<>()`     | Polymorphism (base ↔ derived classes)  |
| `const_cast<>()`       | Adding/removing `const`                |
| `reinterpret_cast<>()` | Low-level pointer operations (dangerous) |

#### ✅ Example: `static_cast`
```cpp
double price = 99.99;
int intPrice = static_cast<int>(price);  // intPrice = 99
```

### ⚠️ Why prefer `static_cast` over C-style:
- Easier to **search** and refactor.
- Compiler can **check for validity**.
- Makes intentions clearer to other developers.

## 🧠 Real-World Scenario

### Imagine this code:
```cpp
int items = 5;
int total = 12;
float average = total / items;
```
**Problem**: Output is `2.0`, not `2.4`, because both are integers.

### Fix with explicit casting:
```cpp
float average = static_cast<float>(total) / items;  // Now it's 2.4
```
